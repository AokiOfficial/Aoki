## Information about this branch

> [!NOTE]
> This branch serves as a **proof-of-concept** of Aoki ported to [Seyfert](https://www.seyfert.dev). It is not stable and will not be so until Seyfert becomes more stable and better structured.

***For you developers***, this branch is a [Seyfert](https://www.seyfert.dev) implementation of Aoki. It was rewritten once again to support a more modularized method of making commands and lifting the hassle of having to handle that part yourself; and lifting the hassle of handling languages yourself. Seyfert, conveniently, did that.

However you don't get a lot of useful information on Seyfert, because it doesn't have a proper documentation. You have a [guide](https://docs.seyfert.dev) to work with, which is obviously quite insufficient (it took me a century to figure out how modals work here). This rewrite is just a **proof-of-concept**, it is not a fully cleaned up prototype to use in production.

For very technical and obscure details I learned with Seyfert, head over to [INSTRUCTIONS.md](/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

All technologies are still the same, except without Discord.js and with Seyfert.

## Disclaimer for self-hosters
Aoki is becoming more difficult to self-host starting from this version where the main server split into different places to offload heavy works. Whatever you do from this version still stands under the impression that *you understand the code and its specifications*, and no support will be handed out to do this.

Aoki's API server is basically the old code mashed together and exposed through a Bun server like it normally does. The full source code of this part is going to be on a new repository and maintained by me frequently. The server contains Aoki's verification API and [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) handlers, which is basically an S3-compatible bucket for all your object storage, to implement a new functionality of [making mappacks for mappools](/src/struct/utils/OsuGame.ts).

Both of these are on Cloudflare Workers, which has a very generous free tier. A poor developer's best friend to keep hobby projects alive is free stuff.

It's also pretty difficult to make sure all of Aoki's dependencies are online at once, so in production use you should implement caching/similar behavior to fallback to something else.

## Local development setup
Make sure you have Bun on your local machine. [Install it here](https://bun.sh). Seyfert also supports Node or whatever it does, check their docs, but I made it work with Bun.

Place all the necessary keys required by first renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env`, and then fill it. **It is recommended that you use only the DEV variant of the keys.**

Start the dev client by running this one-liner (which installs all dependencies and start it):
```bash
bun i && bun dev
```

## Code License & Contribution
[GPL-3.0](/LICENSE).

This is a learning project pushed to production, use any code that makes sense to you, but don't fully copy the entire thing.

To contribute, simply make a fork of this repository, make your changes, then make a pull request. There is a template ready for a standard PR.

To work with the codebase, specifically this branch, make sure:
- You do not edit `tsconfig.json` to make whatever you want works.
- You document the code wherever relevant; i.e. stuff that will be hard to look at without it, if you're making a PR.
- You keep the overall structure intact and consistent. Sync with other files if there is already one (or some) of the same format.
- You stay sane and happy.
