# Implementing new stuff

This is a guide on how to work with the Aoki codebase in general, and how to combat the ambiguity of what Seyfert's state is right now through what I discovered through trial-and-error.

It assumes you have basic understandings of how Discord API for bots roughly works, and the appropriate TypeScript knowledge.

For more realistic examples, refer to the actual files inside the project.

## Table of Contents

This is a fairly long read. Jump to where you want to see:

- [Error handling](#error-handling)
- [Locales](#locales)
- [Database & API](#database--api)
- [Bundling our code](#bundling)
- [Commands](#commands)
- [Extending built-in classes](#extending-built-in-classes)

## Error handling

Error handling in Aoki must be routed through the [AokiError.ts handler](/src/struct/handlers/AokiError.ts):
```ts
import AokiError from '@struct/handlers/AokiError';
...
return AokiError[shorthand_method]({
  sender: i,     // variable with a `send` or `reply` function
  content: ""    // content of the error
  // more parameters here...
});
...
```
This makes sure all errors are properly categorized and prioritized. The file has multiple shorthand functions for common errors throughout the development of the app, but you can construct one yourself if it's rare enough:
```ts
import AokiError from '@struct/handlers/AokiError';
import { ErrorTypes } from '@struct/handlers/AokiError';
...
const error = new AokiError({ 
  ...options, 
  type: ErrorTypes.SELF_CONSTRUCTED 
});
void error.handle();
// logic if this should be ephemeral or logged...
...
```

Otherwise, when an error should be thrown but the `sender` is not a `ChatInputCommandInteraction` or a `Message`, you probably should resort to sending with the proper method instead. Some methods are not available or compatible with the class.

## Locales
Aoki's locales are handled quite messily as of now on Seyfert. Right now, you can access locales from the `CommandContext` (this is built into Seyfert), the `AutocompleteInteraction`, `ChatInputCommandInteraction` and `Message` (this is extended in the code) with:

```ts
// Context
// Used in every command
ctx.t.get(locale)[keys in locale];
// AutocompleteInteraction
// Used to retrieve localized choices
interaction.t[keys in locale];
```

These are not all accessed by a `get` function because `CommandContext#t` is a built-in method. You can override it using `Object#defineProperty` (which is described in the section "Extending built-in classes" below), but I would not recommend doing it this way. In the commands, you only shorten this call by a single line, which is not worth it.

---
Also, at times, you might want to have *choices* inside your options.

Because Discord API does not support localized choices out of the box, we have to use the new Autocomplete feature and handle it accordingly. Inside a command option creation, write a callback function like so:

```ts
...
choice_demonstration: createStringOption({
  description: 'demonstrates localized choices',
  autocomplete: async (i: AutocompleteInteraction) => {
    // Get the localized choices
    const localizedChoices = i.t.command.choices.choice_demonstration;
    // This SubCommand#respondWithLocalizedChoices 
    // method is not a built-in function. It is extended 
    // from the original SubCommand class.
    await this.respondWithLocalizedChoices(
      i,
      localizedChoices
    );
  }
});
...
```

The `SubCommand#respondWithLocalizedChoices` method is implemented as a shorthand for both getting the current focused value of the autocomplete field and responding to the input. You can read the implementation in [extenders/SubCommand.ts](/src/struct/extenders/SubCommand.ts).

## Database & API
Aoki's database and API stuff from earlier v4.4 has recently been moved to a dedicated API to offload heavy tasks, like image processing with `sharp` and OCR with `tesseract.js`. You are free to move it back in because all logics are the same, just with the API difference.

Note that if you want to host the Seyfert side of things, the API is pretty much locked in there, and you wouldn't want to port it back to Seyfert. It is a pain.

However you can have `pm2` on one server and host both the app and the API there, that's convenient and should be practiced.

## Bundling
Seyfert makes it pretty difficult to bundle your code. Seriously. But not all hopes is lost, because when we get to their guide about Cloudflare Workers, which is [here](https://www.seyfert.dev/guide/recipes/cloudflare-workers) (very outdated), we can see some glimmer of hope.

```ts
// Code snippet stripped from the guide
// --- cut ---
// we need to load commands manually
await client.commands!.set('', client, [Ping]);
 
// load languages
await client.langs!.set('', [{ name: 'en', file: EnLang}]);

// load components
await client.components!.set('', client, [ButtonC]);
```

Workers bundle your code using `esbuild`, which implies you actually *can*, in one way or another, bundle your code into a file and use it. But because that guide's section is so outdated - in fact, none of the method on the code above is usable as-is - it makes it pretty difficult to figure out what the hell you have to do.

This is what you're supposed to do for the commands:
- If you're using any of these two decorators, `@GroupsT` and `@LocalesT`, remove them and use `@Groups` and `@Locales` instead. They are *dynamically loaded* and will fall back to nothing on build, causing Discord API errors about your command metadata:
```ts
@Locales([
  ['en-US', 'description here'],
  // add more language...
])
@Groups({
  group: {
    name: [
      ['en-US': 'name'],
      // ...
    ],
    description: [
      ['en-US', 'description'],
      // ...
    ],
    defaultDescription: 'description'
  },
  // add more stuff...
})
```
- You are recommended to put these in another file and import it in, use it dynamically.
- Then you can begin importing the commands manually.
```ts
// we expect an index.ts to be present
import Command from '/path/to/command/directory';
// for some unknown reason, tss gets angry at this line
// even though it works perfectly fine
// @ts-ignore
client.commands.set([Command]);
```

And for the languages - this is the most confusing part.
- Get into the language handler file in the library. In the `LangInstance` declaration, mark `path` optional by adding a `?` behind.
```ts
// --- cut ---
path?: string;
```
- This is not breaking, in fact the function used to check our imports was also assuming `path` is not always present:
```ts
// --- cut ---
if ('path' in file) // ...
```
- Here comes the difficult to realize part. Because the code of the library assumes our keys are inside a property `default`, which is exactly what `import()` does, you need to use top-level await to import the file statically into the handler. The devastating part is that it does not tell you if it couldn't find the file, or you got this wrong and used normal `import` statement instead.
```ts
client.langs.set([
  { language: 'en-US', file: await import('/path/to/en-US.ts') },
  // ...add more language
]);
```

About the events, you need to do this:
```ts
import interactionCreate from '/path/to/event.ts';

client.events.set([
  { 
    data: { name: 'interactionCreate', once: false }, 
    run: (i: any) => interactionCreate.run(i, client, 1) 
  },
  // ...more events
]);
```
Seyfert also can't know if you have bundled your `seyfert.config` or not, so by default you are forced to include it in with the exposed token (not the `process.env`ed one if you don't include `.env`!)

Finally (holy, not done?!), only after you remove the paths from your `seyfert.config` that you can finally bundle your code. Otherwise, Seyfert will trigger its search to something that doesn't exist after bundle.
```ts
// only leave this alone
// other stuff, remove them all
locations: {
  base: "src"
},
```
Bundle your code. It should work now.

All this took me 48 hours to figure out.

## Commands

Command creation with Seyfert is simple with the use of the TypeScript experimental feature, Decorators. Read more about this [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html). For localizations, implement the translations of the command name and description in the translation files.

Aoki's commands philosophy is to make a master command then branching out with subcommands to properly categorize them, e.g. `/anime action` and `/anime search`, so you might want to make a subcommand. The flow is pretty much simple:

```ts
// import stuff here...

// make some options
const options = createStringOption({
  // type: Record<string, {...props}>
  //              ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^
  //               name     options
  default_option: {
    required: true,
    description: 'stuff',
    description_localizations: {
      'en-US': 'stuff',
      'vi': 'các thứ'
    }
  }
  // continue...
})

// declare the default command name and description
// using the @Declare decorator:
@Declare({
  name: 'default-name',
  description: 'default-description'
})
// to provide localizations for the command,
// use the @Locales decorator, mentioned above.
@Options(options)
export default class DefaultName extends SubCommand {
  // and then provide typings of options as a generic here
  async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>) {
    // then you can use the typed options
    const { default_option } = ctx.options;
    // continue...
  };
};
```

Then, because of Seyfert's command structuring, we need to let it know the existence of this subcommand.

Surprisingly this is simple:

```ts
// it's recommended to name this index.ts
// and place it in the same folder as the subcommand
// import the subcommand we just made:
import DefaultName from './default-name';
// ...other imports

@Declare({
  name: 'parent-command',
  description: 'the parent command'
})
// to let it know, we provide the subcommands inside 
// the @Options decorator:
@Options([DefaultName])
// if you have subcommand groups and locales, 
// use the @Groups decorator which was mentioned above too.
// finally declare your command:
export default class ParentCommand extends Command {} // end
```

If you have subcommand groups, then inside of the subcommands of the group, add the `@Group` (without the `s`!) decorator, like this:

```ts
@Group('default-group')
```

That way, you keep all the other file contents intact and commands will still be correctly categorized. Feels like *black magic*, yes?

## Extending built-in classes

Sometimes you might need shorthand functions, or property accessors. Everything like this happens inside the [extenders folder](/src/struct/extenders/).

For instance, if you need to have some string inside the `CommandContext` through some specific property name, go into the file for that class in there (or create a new one if none exists), and add it in:

```ts
// declare your whatever value/function here
const specific_property_name = 'Very important string';
// let the typescript language server know it:
declare module 'seyfert' {
  interface CommandContext {
    specific_property_name: string
  }
};
// finally export that out
// don't export default! 
// you might want to add other things later too!
export { specific_property_name };
```

When you're done adding it there, you still need to put it inside Seyfert. You have only let the TypeScript server know what you wrote is a thing, but Seyfert didn't catch up yet. Get into the `index.ts` file and use the ol' reliable `Object#defineProperties`:

```ts
// --- cut ---
import * as AokiCommandContext from './CommandContext';
import { CommandContext } from 'seyfert';
// in that file, Object#defineProperties is defined as
// _defProp:
_defProp(CommandContext.prototype, {
  specific_property_name: { get: AokiCommandContext.specific_property_name }
});
```

That's it! Now you can use it everywhere in your commands.

```ts
console.log(ctx.specific_property_name); 
// logs: 'Very important string'
```
